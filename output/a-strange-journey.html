	<span class="post-date">mié 29 diciembre 2021</span>
	<p>I've been trying to learn Python and other related skills on-and-off some time now. It's been, and still is both frustrating and rewarding.</p>
<p>Why bother? I'm just an English teacher working at a public school with Windows 7, an old photocopier, chalk and a blackboard. I started my career a long time ago, as a plain translator, which led me to localization and internationalization, and then on to software testing and project management. The closest I came to working in software development was as a localization producer at a large videogame company.</p>
<p>Those jobs were exciting at the time, and demanding. But they didn't pay much, not then, they didn't, not in Spain. And they didn't provide the stability I needed to show in order to get a mortgage and settle down. So I turned to teaching English in public schools, which, believe it or not, paid better and offered life-long stability. Plus, I was getting old and the 60-hour weeks were taking a toll on my health.</p>
<p>It was quite a career change, I remember a fortuneteller friend told me: you will find stability, but not happiness. Not sure he was 100% right, but in terms of working environment, it did feel like travelling back to the 20th century (if not the 19th, in some respects). Don't get me wrong, I have great respect for my colleagues, they're smart people who work hard and care about their students, but it's a balancing act with the lack of resources, the counterproductive policies, and the excess of pointless bureaucray. Despite all that, let's be honest: it's a relatively easy job. Interesting the first 5 or 10 years, but extremely boring after that.</p>
<p>I miss the challenges, the cutting-edge, and the collective exhilaration of problem-solving under pressure. Some may call it masochism. The fact is that I find this strange hobby very rewarding, even if it hasn't been very useful for my current job, except for the occasional web scraping when finding teaching materials, or using regular expressions to deal with text manipulation. I've even been delving in NLP to try to extract vocabulary and text statistics.</p>
<p>All of this wouldn't have been possible even 5 or 10 years ago. The volume of information available now is staggering, and I find it hard to to take advantage of it. I can't say I expect it to lead to another career change, but who knows?</p>
<p>In conclusion: I'm told that the best way to solidify what you learn is to document it and try to explain it. Besides that I need some structure around my chaotic habits. So that's what I'm trying to do here. My intentions are good. But everyone knows the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Hope my future self lives up to my present determination, a least for the time I'll be using this domain name.</p>
