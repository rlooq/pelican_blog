	<p>Not much to do over Christmas, with Omicron-related restrictions and all, so I managed to put together this simple blog between meals. The domain name was my only Black Friday purchase this year, couldn't make up my mind and ended up with this non-sensical title: <strong>Highnoon Ruffles</strong>, which has a cute story behind. I may divulge it one of these days. But for now, suffice it to say I am the Ruffles in that story.</p>
<p>So, anyway, I'm at my parents place for Christmas, and all I brought is a very old (but sturdy) MacBook Pro running Manjaro i3, which has given it a second lease on life. My other laptop is a newer but crankier piece of junk that complaints loudly with the slightest movement. When the fan gets going, it sounds like the dungeons of the Spanish Inquisition. No sane person can ignore it and focus on work. But I digress. Word of wisdom to you, though: never <em>ever</em> buy an HP laptop. Back to the point: the process of making this site was relatively smooth thanks to <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/">Pelican</a>, a Python-based static site generator, and a simple theme adapted from <a href="https://github.com/jvanz/pelican-hyde">Hyde</a>, which is itself based on something else. You gotta love the age of ope source.</p>
<p>The whole thing is hosted for free (https certificate included) on Netlify, which compiles it from a repo on Github. <a href="https://frankcorso.dev/deploying-your-pelican-static-site-to-netlify.html">This article</a> by Frank Corso, does a great job at explaining each step.</p>
<p>Now, after tweaking the CSS and templates in the theme, and once the Netlify deployment is set, all I have to do is write plain-text files with some markdown, which are then converted into HTML by Pelican.</p>
<p>Beautiful, great news, Mr. Ruffles. But then what. What are you going to write about? What is it that you have to say?</p>
<p>Not sure how to answer that, not yet at least. I'll have to figure it out over the next few posts. But let me give you some context: I'm in my forties, no kids to worry about, no pets either. I got the running bug for a while, but now my back pain is killing me, so I had to stop that. An aging man needs to keep his mind focused on one or two personal projects so it doesn't wander into dark territories. Not that I have a lot of free time, but if my day job is all there is, I might as well toast myself to oblivion watching Netflix.</p>
<p>I do what I do: I teach myself new stuff (Python, some web development...), and start hobby projects, I read, and then I write about all of it: in a foreign language, mind you, so please forgive my quirky turns of phrase. Apart from factual errors, I refuse to go back and review my posts, because if I do, I will spend weeks to polish one sentence until I like it, and then I'll change my mind.</p>
<p>The world out there (on- and offline) doesn't make a whole lot of sense anyway, so what's the harm?</p>
