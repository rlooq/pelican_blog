Title: Imagine We The People

Description: Nations may be built upon blatant falsehoods and manipulations, but if they are imagined by enough people, they stand as real and unavoidable as money, borders, or laws. Or power itself.

Nations may be built upon blatant falsehoods and manipulations, but if they are imagined by enough people, they stand as real and unavoidable as money, borders, or laws. Or power itself. 

Kings used to exert a similar amount of real power over unrelated people based on a ghostly fiction. But the masses did not kill and die for kings in the millions, as they have done and will continue to do in the name of their imaginary nations.

Hard facts mean nothing for the proud member of such clubs. National feelings can't ever be reasoned with, so don't waste your time piling up perfectly crafted historical arguments. In the end, we are all apes wielding the bones of our presumed ancestors. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die, etc.

In *[Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_Communities)* (1983),
Benedict Anderson coined the term "imagined communities" as a descriptor for nations: rock-solid realities that we've had to contend with for the last couple of centuries, not a long time in the big scheme of things, but the time we live in. This is an extract from the introduction to that work.


## Imagined Communities

By Benedict Anderson

Theorists of nationalism have often been perplexed, not to say irritated, by these three paradoxes:
1. The objective modernity of nations to the historian's eye vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists,
2. the formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept –in the modern world everyone can, should, will 'have' a nationality, as he or she 'has' a gender– vs. the irremediable particularity of its concrete manifestations, such that, by definition, 'Greek' nationality is *sui generis*.
3. The 'political' power of nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even incoherence. 

In other words, unlike most other isms, nationalism has never produced its own grand thinkers: no Hobbeses, Tocquevilles, Marxes, or Webers. This 'emptiness' easily gives rise, among cosmopolitan and polylingual intellectuals, to a certain condescension. [...]

It is characteristic that even so sympathetic a student of nationalism as Tom Nairn can write that: "Nationalism" is the pathology of modern developmental history, as inescapable as "neurosis" in the individual, with much the same essential ambiguity attaching to it, a similar built-in capacity for descent into dementia, rooted in the dilemmas of helplessness thrust upon most of the world (the equivalent of infantilism for societies) and largely incurable. [...]

It would make things easier if one treated it [nationalism] as if it belonged with 'kinship' and 'religion', rather than with 'liberalism' and 'fascism'.

In anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following definition of the nation: it is an imagined political community –and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.

It is *imagined* because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion. Renan referred to this imagining in his suavely back-handed way when he wrote that "Or l'essence d'une nation est que tous les individus aient beaucoup de choses en commun, et aussi que tous aient oublié bien des choses." 

With a certain ferocity Gellner makes a comparable point when he rules that "Nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it *invents* nations where they do not exist." The drawback to this formulation, however, is that Gellner is so anxious to show that nationalism masquerades under false pretenses that he assimilates 'invention' to 'fabrication' and 'falsity', rather than to 'imagining' and 'creation'. In this way he implies that 'true' communities exist which can be advantageously juxtaposed to nations.

In fact, __all communities larger than primordial villages or face-to-face contact (and perhaps even these) are imagined__. Communities are to be distinguished, not by their falsity/genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined. [...]

The nation is imagined as *limited* because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations. No nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind. The “most messianic nationalists do not dream of a day when all the members of the human race will join their nation in the way that it was possible, in certain epochs, for, say, Christians to dream of a wholly Christian planet.

It is imagined as *sovereign* because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such religions, and the allomorphism between each faith’s ontological claims and territorial stretch, nations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so. The gage and emblem of this freedom is the sovereign state.

Finally, it is imagined as a *community*, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.

These deaths bring us abruptly face to face with the central problem posed by nationalism: what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history (scarcely more than two centuries) generate such colossal sacrifices? I believe that the beginnings of an answer lie in the cultural roots of nationalism.
