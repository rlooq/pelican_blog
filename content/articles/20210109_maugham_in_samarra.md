Title: Appointment in Samarra
Date: 2021-01-09


An Appointment in Samarra is Somerset Maugham's 1933 retelling of an ancient Mesopotamian tale about the encounter of Death and a man from Baghdad. 

The moral of the story is obvious after reading it. 

What one has to wonder, though, is: Who is Death talking to? And what about the merchant's familiarity with Death? Who addresses Death like that? "Don't you dare go around threatening my servant, Grim Reaper, or you'll hear from me!"

Reminds me of [Blue Oyster Cult's classic](https://youtu.be/oF7mP2LASCo): 
> *Seasons don't fear the reaper*  
> *Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain... we can be like they are*  
> *Come on baby... don't fear the reaper!*  

etc.

## The Appointment in Samarra
__As retold by W. Somerset Maugham__

*Death speaks*: There was a merchant in Bagdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trembling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the market-place I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death that jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there Death will not find me. The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went. Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, Why did you make a threating getsture to my servant when you saw him this morning? That was not a threatening gesture, I said, it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Bagdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.
