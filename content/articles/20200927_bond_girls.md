Title: Bond And Bond Girls
Date: 2020-09-17


In the decade going from 1953 to 1964, when most of Ian Fleming's Bond stories were published, the Cold War was in full swing, with spies from both sides of the iron curtain heating up the public imagination to melting point. Tales of intrigue and espionage were the thing then, and in that context Ian Fleming came up with his James Bond, "a suave connoisseur of luxury, a world traveler, ruthless killer, skilled wielder of weaponry, rakish womanizer, and virtually indestructible force for the defense of Western society"[^1]. 

In a way, agent 007 made the Cold War elegant and sexy. He moved our minds away from nuclear apocalypse and towards martinis shaken (not stirred), beautiful girls in bikinis... in other words, *carpe diem*. 

Did that help in preventing us from obliterating life on Earth? Maybe not, or maybe just a little. In March 1964, Playboy published a pictorial titled _Girls of Russia and the Iron Curtain_, which some claimed was one of the first signs of thawing tensions in the Cold War. 

Although I've seen most of the Bond films, I've never read any of the books. And today, I was curious to see how the 007 in the books treated the ladies back in the 50s. And how the ladies responded to his advances. So I downloaded a bunch of Bond texts from Project Gutenberg and played a bit with `grep` and regular expressions to find some relevant passages.

Assuming it all started with a daring kiss, I pictured Bond-James-Bond always taking the initiative, but a simple search of the bigrams *kissed her* and *kissed him* proved me wrong.

## The Art Of Kissing

It all starts with private kisses behind closing doors, and tears, and gentle licks 'on the corner of the mouth' in _Casino Royale_; and goes trough a wide variety of exchanges all the way to 'yielding, bud-like mouths' or worrying impotence in _You Only Live Twice_.

Here are some extracts:

### Casino Royale (1953)

> Bond pushed her inside and closed the door. Then he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks. [...]

> She led him to the door and there they held tightly to each other. Then he kissed her again and she shut the door behind him. [...]

> Bond bent and kissed her. He tasted the tears on her cheek. [...]

> She leant over and kissed him on the corner of the mouth, then she brushed the black comma of hair back from his damp forehead. [...]

> [...] she drew his head slowly towards her and kissed him gently on the lips. Then she let him go and turned off the light. [...]


### Live And Let Die (1954)

> He put his hand on her left breast and kissed her white throat. [...]

> She had clung to Bond. 'I want to get away from here,' she said, her eyes frightened. 'I have a feeling...' She didn't end the sentence. Bond kissed her. [...]

> Then she brought his lips against hers again and kissed him long and lasciviously, as if she was the man and he the woman. [...]

> Then she brushed the hair away from his forehead, and kissed him again, lightly and tenderly. [...]

> She put her arms round his neck. 'Don't think I'm being hysterical.' She kissed him. 'Now you can go. I just wanted to see you. Come back quickly.' [...]

### Diamonds Are Forever (1956)

> Bond looked quietly at her mouth and then kissed her hard on the lips.

> And then she pulled his face against hers and kissed him once, hard and long on the lips, with a fierce tenderness that was almost without sex.


### From Russia With Love (1957)

> He read her eyes. He bent and put his hands on the fur over her breasts and kissed her hard on the lips. [...]

> 'You'll do nothing of the sort,' she had said coldly. Later she had kissed him goodbye with a sudden warmth, and for the hundredth time Bond had wondered why he bothered with other women when the most darling of them all was his secretary. [...]


### Dr. No (1958)

> He took her in his arms and kissed her hard on the lips. He held her and looked down into the shining blue eyes. [...]

> As he bent over, two arms were thrown round his neck. He stood up. The golden body blazed in the white tiled bathroom. She kissed him hard and clumsily on the lips. [...]


### Goldfinger (1959)

> Bond had taken her to the station and had kissed her once hard on the lips and had gone away. It hadn't been love, but a quotation had come into Bond's mind as his cab moved out of Pennsylvania station: 'Some love is fire, some love is rust. But the finest, cleanest love is lust.' [...]

> She kissed him quickly on the cheek. She straightened herself. She said toughly, 'I'll see you in my dreams, Handsome,' and went off to the galley. [...]


### For Your Eyes Only (1960)

> The scent of her body had a warm animal tang. Bond kissed her once softly on the lips and once again, hard. [...]

> The fat man was grinning delightedly. He came up with Bond and, to Bond's horror, threw open his arms, clutched Bond to him and kissed him on both cheeks. Bond said: 'For God's sake, Colombo.' [...]


### On Her Majecty's Secret Service (1963)

> He kissed her, at first softly and then with fierceness. [...]

> Bond kissed her between the shoulder-blades but said nothing. [...]

> 'I am going to see you again, aren't I?' Bond held her tight and kissed her. [...]

> 'You are a pig,' she said indignantly. 'We've got so much to talk about and all you think about is drink.' Bond laughed. He put an arm gingerly round her neck and kissed her long and passionately. [...]

### You Only Live Twice (1964)

> As Mariko's busy fingers proceeded to remove his trousers and then his shirt, he lifted her chin and kissed her full on the soft, yielding, bud-like mouth. [...]

> But while he kissed her occasionally and often held her hand, his body seemed totally unaware of her, however much she pressed herself against him and even caressed him with her hand. Had the wound made him impotent? [...]


> She came up to him and threw her arms round his neck and kissed him full on the lips. Before he could respond, she had pulled down her goggles and had dived [...]



## Moving On To Second Base

However, that bigram alone doesn't tell the whole story. There's more to the author's mind than those cinematic kisses. Maybe we should look for the physical descriptions, and Mr. Fleming seems to have been quite fond of *breasts*, both in describing women's bodies, and as the objects of Bond's desire by themselves. That female body part is mentioned 83 times in the 12 texts I'm working with. Here are some of them, again, chronologically:

### Casino Royale (1953)

> He put his arms round her and put a hand over each breast. They filled his hands and the nipples were hard against his fingers. [...]


### Live And Let Die (1954)

> She watched his eyes on her and nonchalantly drew her forearms together in her lap so that the valley between her breasts deepened. [...]

> He freed his right hand and put it between their bodies, feeling her hard breasts, each with its pointed stigma of desire. [...]

> He put his hand on her left breast and kissed her white throat. [...]


### Moonraker (1955)

> The wrapover bodice just showed the swell of her breasts, which were as splendid as Bond had guessed from the measurements on her record sheet. [...]

> [...] the pointed hillocks of her breasts, so close to him, and the soft flat stomach descending to the mystery of her tightly closed thighs. [...]


### Diamonds Are Forever (1956)

> The valley between her breasts opened for him. She looked up at him through the smoke of her cigarette, and suddenly her eyes widened and then slowly narrowed again. "I like you," they said. [...]


### From Russia With Love (1957)

> Her arms and breasts were faultless. A purist would have disapproved of her behind. [...]

> There was the confidence of having been loved in the proud breasts and the insolently lilting behind--the assertion of a body that knows  what it can be for. [...]

> The breasts were small, and, unlike the big breasts of the other girl, hardly swelled the rags of her shift. [...]

> The tips of fingers showed, holding the sheet up over the face. Lower down the breasts stood up like hills under snow. [...]

> While his mouth went on kissing her, his hand went to her left breast and held it, feeling the peak hard with desire under his fingers. [...]


### Dr. No (1958)

> Bond's hand was on her left breast. Its peak was hard with passion. [...]

> Bond took his hand away from her breast and put it round her neck. [...]

> Bond put out a hand to her left breast and held it hard. [...]


### Goldfinger (1959)

> He unbuttoned her jacket and put his hand against her warm breast. The heart fluttered like a pigeon under his palm. [...]

> Bond's right hand came slowly up the firm, muscled thighs, over the flat soft plain of the stomach to the right breast. Its point was hard with desire. [...]


### The Spy Who Loved Me (1962)

> So when the lights went out again and his hands came back it seemed natural that they should go to my breasts and that excited me. [...]

> [...] then came the soft assault on my breasts and then on my body, all so pleasurable, so calm, so lacking in drama [...]


### On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1963)

> He locked the door behind him and came over and sat on the edge of her bed and put one hand firmly on the little hill that was her left breast. [...]

### You Only Live Twice (1964) 

> He reached for Mariko's helping hands and watched her breasts tauten as she pulled him out and towards her. [...]

> Her arms and legs were longer and less masculine than is usual with Japanese girls, and the day before, Bond had seen that her breasts and buttocks were firm and proud and that her stomach was almost flat--a beautiful figure [...]


## Misogyny

Now, Ian Fleming has often been accused of misogyny for his treatment of _rape_, among other issues. Different times? I guess. But still, pushing that angle a little further, I checked and there's this one crazy quote from as early as Casino Royale (1953), where Bond reflects on his feelings for a certain Bond girl (the _italics_ are mine):

> She was thoughtful and full of consideration without being slavish and without compromising her arrogant spirit. And now he knew that she was profoundly, excitingly sensual, but that the conquest of her body, because of the central privacy in her, would each time have _the sweet tang of rape_. Loving her physically would each time be a thrilling voyage without the anticlimax of arrival. She would surrender herself avidly, he thought, and greedily enjoy all the intimacies of the bed without ever allowing herself to be possessed.


Disturbing calculations of a rapist or the fair game of seduction? Half and half, I guess. You reach your own conclusions. 

Finally, I suppose we could also check the adjectives that Fleming applied to the words 'woman', 'women', 'girl', 'girls', at least superficially, to corroborate his general attitude:

> __Positive adjectives__: artless, attractive, beautiful, best, better, brave, bright, dear, desirable, envied, extraordinary, fine, fine-looking, fighting, golden, good, handsome, hard, healthy, intelligent, lovely, marvellous, passionate, powerful, prettiest, pretty, remarkable, rich, smiling, straightforward, wonderful, young.

> __Negative adjectives__: beaten, blithering, call, career, chorus, cleaning, coshed, country, damn, damned, dead, discarded, dull, easy, expensive, faded, former, heavy, huge, innocent, left-out, lone, lonely, neurotic, occasional, older, pestiferous, plain, poor, private, prize, round, scrawny, sentencious, sick, silly, simple, sobbing, solitary, street, stumpy, sullen.

> __Not sure which__: big, bright-faced, bronzed, chill, coloured, dancing, dark-haired, different, diving, elderly, excited, fair-haired, giggling, kneeling, laughing, little, matronly, naked, new, older, particular, pink, principal, proud, real, senior, single, sleeping, smaller, smiling, sunburned, tall, ticket, undercover, unknown, unlimited, white, wild.

## Conclusion

It was a different time in pop culture, a different Bond too, which has been turned on its head in more recent interpretations. What is clear to me is that James Bond, and all the beautiful women he encounters (together with all the iconic villains he contends with) live in a more exciting world than the one we inhabit from Monday to Friday in 2020. A Bond-movie marathon is in order.
