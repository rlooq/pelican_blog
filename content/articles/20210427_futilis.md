Title: Plugging the Holes
Date: 2021-04-27


Day in and day out you go through the motions, and in the odd hours that are left, you seek randomly, and then forget. Every little quest vanishes from memory, and here you are: with this vague feeling of *futility* (from the latin *futilis*,"leaky", said of brittle containers that serve no purpose). You are a useless, leaky container racing against time and emptiness.  

Once you come to terms with that, the only logical course of action (short of giving up) is plugging the leaks. Accept the aid of writing things down and re-reading them. You really need the journaling habit: sit down and type, think with your fingers, if nothing else.  

First set the scene, where you are, how you feel, where you've been recently, and what you've achieved. Choose wisely what's worth saving from the wreck of your days. Then set a course. And later come back and remember, so you can hold on to a narrative thread, fictional as it may be, as everything is. The meaning of life is making it real for a while, and then let go (with or without a fight).  

**Futilis**  
&nbsp;**1.** _qui laisse échapper ce qu'il contient,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qui ne retien pas, ne garde pas  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vas qui fuit)_  
&nbsp;**2.** _fragile_  
&nbsp;**3.** _vain, léger, frivole_
