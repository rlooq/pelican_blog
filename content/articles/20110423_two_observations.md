Title: Two Observations
Date: 2011-04-23


I always wondered why. Why those long, convoluted sentences instead of shorter, simpler ones. Why that disregard for the reader's comfort. Then, this morning, I set Henry James against Ambrose Bierce. Going, say, from Bierce's "The Damned Thing" to James' "The Two Faces," it stands out clearly: James' labyrinthine style requires full concentration and so makes you pay more attention than you would like to. It's a hook that holds you against your will. 

Bierce's economy of style, however, makes you feel at home, you relax to the point of dozing off, and you would miss the important details, if there were any. We're lazy by nature, we need the discomfort, we need to be on edge and grind our teeth in frustration.

Later, reading on my laptop one of the less newsworthy articles of El Pais on Sunday, I noticed that the writer made several 'dated' and sort of arcane references, assuming smart readers would recognize them (I didn't, not totally, and even less would a younger reader, I bet). This happens a lot lately, everyone's a master of their limited domain for a limited time, but that domain waits for no-one. 

Despite globalization and easy access, there's so much going on, so much to know, that people can't possibly share the same context anymore. Sure, we have the trending topics, the most-emailed articles, the global blockbusters, but each fits variously-sized niches. I'm not into superhero movies or Harry Potter, I'm going to miss any reference to any of them to illustrate whatever is happening in the world. 

At any rate, it's not the same as back in the 80s, here in Spain we had only two TV channels, and they defined our common reality: we were all good neighbours in it. Now, for better or worse, knowledge and experience of the world are becoming so fragmanted that it's nearly impossible to find that recognizable common ground where you say, yes, I know what you're talking about, your nuance, I've been there. Inside jokes are being kept inside one single head, or two. Maybe it's just me, getting old and confused, witnessing a generation gap for the first time.

Speaking of images or words as representations of reality, Lugones said "Every word is a dead metaphor. This statement is, of course, a metaphor" --and it seems to me that newer metaphors have a harder time becoming fully coined words. They come and go, and lie forgotten in old hard drives. We may have seen them at some point, but our attention was busy elsewhere, who were these metaphors? Who cares? Who has the time and energy to find out what they really mean?

So, maybe the only understanding audience worth the trouble is one's future self, but he might be a stranger by then. Dear me.
