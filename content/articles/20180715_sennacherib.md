Title: Just You Wait, Sennacherib
Date: 2018-07-15


*The Destruction of Sennacherib* is a poem by Lord Byron first published in 1815 in his *Hebrew Melodies*. It is based on the biblical account of the historical Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC by Assyrian king Sennacherib. 

According to the Bible (2 Kings 18:13), the Assyrian army came "against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them." When the Assyrians were besieging Jerusalem, King Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, and Isaiah conveyed the reply from Jehovah: "I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake." During the following night the Angel of the Lord "smote in the camp of the Assyrians," so by morning most of the Assyrian army was found "as dead corpses.‚Äù

The rhythm of the poem has a feel of a galloping horse as the Assyrian rides into battle. 

It's best enjoyed when you recite it to yourself while walking in the city, breathing the car fumes, covering your ears from the revved-up motorbike engines, and stepping on dog shit. It's a kind of prayer for the Angel of Death to spread his wings and smite those four-wheeled idols of Baal, those attention-seeking riders, those cohorts of lazy dog walkers. 

## The Destruction of Sennacherib

The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,  
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;  
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,  
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.  

Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,  
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:  
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,  
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.  

For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,  
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;  
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,  
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!  

And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,  
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;  
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,  
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.  

And there lay the rider distorted and pale,  
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:  
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,  
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.  

And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,  
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;  
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,  
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!
