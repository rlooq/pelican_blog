Title: Winter in Arunda
Date: 2022-01-23
Description: A pathetic complain about the cold and some angry prehistoric ghosts in Ronda, and a painful realization of my physical and mental limitations.

When the African continent crashed into Europe, 50 million years ago, a bunch of limestone mountains rose up from the northern branch of the Tethys ocean, squeezing up a small plateau where Ronda (pop. 35,000) sits in 2022. 

Wherever you stand, you're surrounded by mountains, dark green and reddish gray during the day, purple with an orange background at dusk, and a nighmarish black in the moonlight. 

Overall, the constant presence of their ominous bulks makes you uneasy: everyday you admire their majesty and their living transformations, you daydream about somehow responding to that ancestral call and head for the peaks, but deep inside you have an uncertain feeling of being threatened rather than welcome by them. 

The Romans called this town *Arunda*: a description, more than a name, meaning "surrounded by mountains." And earlier Iberian or Celtic settlers probably referred to it in similar terms. Surrounded and outnumbered. 

In 1912, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke said that these mountains *spread out like a psalter you could sing psalms from*. For him, living in Ronda was a liberation, and I had been hoping for the same, after a pretty crappy couple of years.

We moved here last summer, knowing that it wouldn't be easy after almost 20 years in Madrid. And it wasn't. The decision had been complicated too, with many factors to weigh in: being closer to my aging parents, escaping a toxic job, a break from a city that had felt oppresive during the pandemic... 

So far I can't say Ronda feels like a liberation. But its natural beauty makes up for most inconveniences. It is *beautiful* and *cold* (in winter). Not *nordic cold*, mind you: when it doesn't rain, one can still get out in the sun and it feels great for a few hours between noon and 4pm. Still, when not on the move, it's *cold* for my cranky bones.

And, objectively, the temperature is not much lower than in Madrid. It must be the humidity or some kind of cosmic energy messing with us. We do live in the outskirts of town, which are in lower ground and the air feels more damp than uptown. And here, people walk their dogs around a prehistoric burial ground, now covered in dog poop. That makes for some unhappy ghosts in my book. Now that I think of it, we've been having some strange nightmares lately. But let's not lose our marbles just yet. 

Whatever the reason, the fact remains: in the house we're renting, one dares not sit down for too long. I can't feel my fingers as I type, not to mention my toes. I haven't felt my toes since last October, I believe they're still there, hibernating in two layers of socks.

That, and the ailments of my 4th decade on this Earth (bad back, migraines ...), have made me painfully aware of the physical limitations of a furless, overexposed ape who doesn't understand shit about the world and feels cranky in a new environment. But there's still hope, and a psalter to sing psalms from.

It was Rilke who wrote:

> Let everything happen to you  
> Beauty and terror.  
> Just keep going. No feeling is final.
