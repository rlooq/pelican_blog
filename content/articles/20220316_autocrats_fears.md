Title: Anxious Apes with Nuclear Weapons
Date: 2022-03-16
Description: Autocrats surrounded by yes men, living in a fearful reality of their own creation. A recipe for disaster.

It is clear by now just how aligned China and Russia seem to be in their challenge to any kind of democratic sovereignty.

This [article on Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-03-16/xi-jinping-trouble), emphasizes the growing palallels between the courts of emperors Putin and Xi Jinping, which make for a scary period ahead. Anxious apes with nuclear weapons, that's how everything goes to hell in a hand basket.

Where I disagree, humbly, is the emphasis on fear, paranoia and isolation as the basis for their behavior, which seems to underestimate these two political beasts. 

In politics, like in most walks of life, I'm sure there's also plain hatred towards the opponent, self-aggrandizing ambition, and patient, ruthless calculation to strike when the opportunity is ripe to advance one's designs. But this is no office squabble, this has apocalyptic implications. And that requires fighting back in kind when necessary (as was the case during the Cold War). Diplomacy is the priority, but it has its limits, as we have seen during the past few weeks.

The recommendation laid out at the end of the article --i.e. direct and consistent communication with these autocrats, to give them a reality check-- sounds naive, considering their deliberate atrocities (Ukraine, Xinjiang), but what do I know?

Here are some extracts:

> It is becoming clear from his speeches and articles that Xi’s outlook on China’s security environment in the coming decade is increasingly pessimistic. [...] The United States, Xi believes, has formalized a policy of containment toward Beijing. When Washington speaks of working with “allies and partners,” Xi hears echoes of Cold War–era encirclement, enacted through what he calls “exclusive small circles [and] blocs that polarize the world.” This diagnosis arguably led Xi to draw closer to Putin and Moscow in the months leading up to their meeting in February and is why he will not abandon Russia moving forward.  

> But it is not just pessimism that animates Xi’s worldview; it is a strong sense of nationalism, fueled by his confidence in the Chinese Communist Party’s economic and military power and his dismissive attitude toward the cohesion and stability of the United States and other democracies.  

> [...] Xi’s actions indicate that he is comfortable asserting Beijing’s interests even when they clash with the capabilities and resolve of the United States and its allies. There are numerous examples of this dynamic, from China’s evisceration of Hong Kong’s democratic institutions to its ongoing campaign of economic coercion against Australia. [...] Xi’s risk tolerance appears to have grown in response to his shifting assessments of the global balance of power.  

> The combination of an unconstrained and nationalist autocrat who harbors an increasingly bleak view of the external environment makes for a potentially volatile period ahead.  

> [...] To compensate, the United States and its allies must prioritize __direct communication with Xi to ensure that alternative ideas puncture his leadership bubble__. It will also be critical for the leaders of like-minded countries to __convey consistent messages__ during their own separate interactions with China’s leadership.
