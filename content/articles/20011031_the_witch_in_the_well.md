Title: The Witch In The Well

Description: A story from my childhood, or how I learned about the underworld.


When I was 5, we all lived at my grandparents' place, an old, whitewashed Andalusian house with a backyard full of all kinds of plants overflowing from a million pots. Stems and leaves and flowers spread on the floor and hung from white walls as if the backyard was a living thing attached to the house. On top of that, my grandfather had about thirty singing birds distributed in cages of different sizes all around the house and yard, and every morning it was a talent competition. I would wake up to a splendid and chaotic symphony of birds chirping on top of each other, news of the day on the radio, pots and pans clanging in the kitchen, and busy women talking about everything and everyone.

## The Well

At the end of the backyard there was a well on a corner, and I was too short to see inside. Sometimes my dad or my uncle would lift me up so I could see how deep it went. For me it was the sight of horror itself: the dark tube would return your deformed and distant reflection on a little circle of water at the bottom. And yet, I kept asking them to show me, I couldn't stop looking. They had to put me down, their arms tired, while I asked to look again.

According to them adults, there was an evil witch living at the bottom of the well, and if I didn't behave, that witch would come out and take me down with her on a full-moon night.

## The Witch

I didn't really know what they meant, I lacked any kind of visual reference: we had no TV or Halloween or children books. My concept of a 'witch' back then wasn't that of an old woman with a broom (what kind of sissy would be scared of that anyway?). In my imagination (in my gut), the word 'witch' referred to a huge, fuzzy and elastic monster that could come out of the well and stretch out all the way to my bedroom's window facing the backyard. I had a lot of nightmares where that smoky monster grabbed me and hurled me out of the window and into the depths of the well. My fear was such that I used to sleep all curled up in my bed so my feet would be as far from the window as possible. I also looked at the moon every night, hoping it wasn't full.

At some point during that time, my cousin came to visit and stayed a few nights. And it so happened that the first night there was a full moon. I told her about the 'witch' and, even though she pretended not to believe me, I could see in her eyes the same kind of horror I felt in my stomach. After much debate, we decided that if we threw our toys inside the well, they would lead the witch's attention away from us, or maybe she would be satisfied with our sacrifice as compensation for our bad behavior. We did it, as a kind of game, throwing the toys in at a distance (of course, we didn't dare to get too close to that well). I guess we got carried away and ended up throwing in all of them, much to the dismay of our parents when they found out later on. The only survivors were my soccer ball and some picture cards, I wasn't willing to pay so high a price.

Anyway, that very night we heard a lot of screaming and moaning coming from the backyard. In our young minds, the witch had accepted the bribe and taken some other kid in the neighborhood. We even bet on who she might have taken, maybe some newborn, or the girl at the corner, the one with the thick glasses.

The next morning we got up early, eager to find out who had been the unlucky one. And we did. Everyone was in the backyard, standing around the well while my grandpa pulled the rope with some effort. The bucket came up and he poured its contents for all to see in horror. The body made a dull thump and the splash of water followed. It lay flat on the floor, soaking wet, lifeless: a dead ginger cat, likely it slipped from the neighbour's roof and into the well. Poor thing.

## The Lessons

That day I learned three lessons: bribery works in the supernatural world too, cats can't swim, and death feels wet and cold and heavy like water in a well.
