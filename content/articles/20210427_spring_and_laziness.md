Title: Spring and the Lazy-Ass Artist as an Old Man
Date: 2021-04-27
 
Weeks come and go with a recognizable pattern. There's something urgent to do, I postpone it and get anxious about it, then I do it and move on. Moods swing like the Spring weather. Every other day, the relative peace is broken by tragicomic battles between co-workers (overblown rhetoric about rights, injustice and abuse), while I try to pull through this year and dream of leaving this pantomime behind. 

Then, at the weekend, I continue reading Augustine's tribulations, which are beginning to make me sleepy, to be honest. Last week I got Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" from Amazon and started reading it over the weekend, as a continuation to MacIntyre's survey of ethics throughout history.

It's definitely an easier read. So far, it feels right to shift the *state of nature* away from the airs of Hobbes and Rousseau and closer to the monkeys that we really are: kin-bound, altruistically self-interested, attached to old rules and forgetting the reasons why they were instituted. Scary detail: violence is necessary as a jolt to fix a broken system every now and then.

When we can, we go for a walk. It feels good to witness the explosion of Spring all over the place. On the other hand, art resists me. I keep questioning the time I seem to *waste* on it without improving, but I can't overcome the fear (of failure) to embark on something bigger than crappy doodles. 

Fear might be just an excuse. I should probably pin it on laziness and procrastination, but also on the fact that I'm spreading myself too thin, what with journal writing, reading, house-keeping, family duties, work, etc.

etc.
