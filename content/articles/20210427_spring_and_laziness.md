Title: Spring and the Lazy-Ass Artist as an Old Man
Date: 2021-04-27
 
Weeks come and go with a recognizable pattern. There's something urgent to do, I postpone it and get anxious about it, then I do it and move on. Moods swing like the Spring weather. Every other day, the relative peace is broken by tragicomic battles between co-workers (overblown rhetoric about rights, injustice and abuse), while I try to pull through this year and dream of leaving this pantomime behind. 

Then, at the weekend, I continue reading Augustine's tribulations, which are beginning to make me sleepy, to be honest. Last week I got Fukuyama's ["The Origins of Political Order"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Political_Order) from Amazon and started reading it over the weekend, as a continuation to [MacIntyre's survey of ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Ethics) throughout history. MacIntyre pretty much equates ethics to politics (as in collective ethics = politics), that's why I ended up with Fukuyama.

It's definitely an easier read. So far, it feels right to shift the *state of nature* away from the stale airs of Hobbes and Rousseau and closer to the monkeys that we really are: kin-bound, altruistically self-interested, attached to old rules and forgetting the reasons why those rules were instituted. Scary detail: violence is necessary as a jolt to fix a broken system every now and then.

When we can, we go for a walk. It feels good to witness the explosion of Spring all over the place. On the other hand, my half-assed artistic hobby resists me. I keep questioning the time I seem to *waste* on it without improving, but I can't overcome the fear (of failure) to embark on something bigger than crappy doodles. 

Fear might be just an excuse. I should probably pin it on the usual laziness and procrastination, but also on the fact that I'm spreading myself too thin, what with journal writing, reading, house-keeping, family duties, work, etc.
