Title: Fondling An Error Long Since Exploded
Date: 2022-02-22
Description: Dr. Johnson's warning about self-isolating in order to focus. Learning happens in society. Solitude leads to laziness.

[Dr. Johnson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson) is the story of a sickly boy who by talent, tenacity, and intelligence became the foremost literary figure and the most formidable conversationalist of his time. 

The disparity between his background and achievement gives his life and opinions especial interest. The son of Michael Johnson, a bookseller, he suffered from a number of physical afflictions since childhood. By his own account, he was born "almost dead," and he early contracted scrofula (tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands). Throughout his life, he was nearly blind in his left eye and suffered from highly noticeable tics that some have later diagnosed as Tourette syndrome. 

His most successful period was during the publications of two periodicals, [The Rambler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rambler), and later, The Adventurer. His essays focused on daily realities, but also on literature, criticism and authorship. In all of them, Johnson's declared intention was to "inculcate wisdom or piety" in conformity with Christianity.

Whatever his intention, here is an extract that I find useful as a reminder to counter my own desert-hermit tendencies:

## Solitude Not Eligible

__by Samuel Johnson__

SOME studies require a continued prosecution of the same train of thought, such as is too often interrupted by the petty avocations of common life: sometimes, likewise, it is necessary, that a multiplicity of objects be at once present to the mind; and every thing, therefore, must be kept at a distance, which may perplex the memory, or dissipate the attention. 

But though learning may be conferred by solitude, its application must be attained by general converse. He has learned to no purpose, that is not able to teach; and he will always teach unsuccessfully, who cannot recommend his sentiments by his diction or address. 

Even the acquisition of knowledge is often much facilitated by the advantages of society: he that never compares his notions with those of others, readily acquiesces in his first thoughts, and very seldom discovers the objections which may be raised against his opinions; he, therefore, often thinks himself in possession of truth, when he is only fondling an error long since exploded. 

He that has neither companions nor rivals in his studies, will always applaud his own progress, and think highly of his performances, because he knows not that others have equalled or excelled him. 

And I am afraid it may be added, that the student who withdraws himself from the world, will soon feel that ardour extinguished which praise or emulation had enkindled, and take the advantage of secrecy to sleep rather than to labour.
