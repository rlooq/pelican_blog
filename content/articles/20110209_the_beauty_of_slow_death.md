Title: The Beauty Of Slow Death
Date: 2011-02-09


The sun's been out for a week and it's finally getting warmer, which pushes people's moods slightly up. But in Madrid that also means pollution, the dry, itchy kind. With no wind or rain for two weeks, an ugly cloud of dust and sulfur dioxide travels every street and penetrates every window, eye, and nostril. 

Those buildings across the road look like ghostly factory chimneys in the distance. The sky blue has mutated into a kind of reddish grey. And from the M40 you can see what locals refer to as â€˜the black beret' over the skyline, a dark dome supported by internal combustion.

But hey, a blob or greyish blood when you blow your nose (and maybe lung cancer in the long run) is a small price to pay for a sunny mood now, after such an unforgiving winter. 

So much for the new year's "smoking ban in public spaces."

As the comic book character would say: in a rotten world without ethics, all we have left is aesthetics. 

In the meantime we die slowly, and then suddenly.
