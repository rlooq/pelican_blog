Title: The Liberal Order
Date: 2022-03-09
Description: Fukuyama frames the current situation in Ukraine in the context of a liberal order under attack from many fronts (within and without), and taken for granted by the very people who benefit from it. Hopefully the brave resistance of Ukrainians is an example and a wake-up call.

In this free-to-read [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/d0331b51-5d0e-4132-9f97-c3f41c7d75b3), Fukuyama takes a step back to frame the current war in Ukraine in the context of a liberal order under attack from many fronts (within and without), and taken for granted by the very people who benefit from it. 

It's nothing new, he's been developing this historical view for the last few decades. The whole thing is more complex: [these two volumes](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/28/francis-fukuyama-political-order-political-decay-review-magisterial-overview) lay out the evolution of our current political institutions from prehuman times. 

The first volume begins with politics among our primate ancestors and follows the story through the emergence of tribal societies, the growth of the first modern state in China, the beginning of the rule of law in India and the Middle East, and the development of political accountability in Europe up until the eve of the French Revolution.

The second volume takes up from the French Revolution and examines the effects of corruption on governance, and why some societies have been successful at rooting it out. He also explores the different legacies of colonialism in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. And finally, he reckons with the future of democracy in the face of a rising global problems.

But the FT article is a good summary/reminder for our current purposes. Here are the main takeaways:

> Liberalism is a doctrine, first enunciated in the 17th century, that seeks to __control violence__ by lowering the sights of politics. It recognises that __people will not agree__ on the most important things — such as which religion to follow — but that they need to tolerate fellow citizens with views different from their own.

> It does this by respecting the __equal rights and dignity of individuals, through a rule of law and constitutional government that checks and balances the powers of modern states__. Among those rights are the rights to own property and to transact freely, which is why __classical liberalism__ was strongly associated with high levels of economic growth and prosperity in the modern world. In addition, classical liberalism was typically associated with modern natural science, and the view that science could help us to understand and manipulate the external world to our own benefit.

> Many of those foundations are now under attack. Populist conservatives intensely resent the open and diverse culture that thrives in liberal societies, and they long for a time when everyone professed the same religion and shared the same ethnicity. [...]

> The liberal values of tolerance and free speech have also been challenged from the left. Many progressives feel that liberal politics, with its debate and consensus-building, is too slow and has grievously failed to address the economic and racial inequalities that have emerged as a result of globalisation. Many progressives have shown themselves willing to limit free speech and due process in the name of social justice.

> Both the anti-liberal right and left join hands in their distrust of science and expertise. On the left, a line of thought stretches from 20th-century structuralism through postmodernism to contemporary critical theory that questions the authority of science. [...] This same distrust of the objectivity of science has now wandered over to the far right, where conservative identity increasingly revolves around scepticism towards vaccines, public health authorities and expertise more generally.

> [...] classical liberalism was reinterpreted over the years, and evolved into tendencies that in the end proved self-undermining. On the right, the economic liberalism of the early postwar years morphed during the 1980s and 1990s into what is sometimes labelled “__neoliberalism__”. [...] under the influence of economists such as Milton Friedman and the “Chicago School”, the market was worshipped and the state increasingly demonised as the enemy of economic growth and individual freedom. Advanced democracies under the spell of neoliberal ideas began trimming back welfare states and regulation, [...] leading to large increases in inequality over the past two generations.

> [...] it was carried to extremes and led, for example, to deregulation of US financial markets in the 1980s and 1990s that destabilised them and brought on financial crises such as the subprime meltdown in 2008. Worship of efficiency led to the outsourcing of jobs and the destruction of working-class communities in rich countries, which laid the grounds for the rise of populism in the 2010s.

> On both the right and the left, foundational liberal ideas were pushed to extremes that then eroded the perceived value of liberalism itself. Economic freedom evolved into an anti-state ideology, and personal autonomy evolved into a “woke” progressive worldview that celebrated diversity over a shared culture. These shifts then produced their own backlash, where the left blamed growing inequality on capitalism itself, and the right saw liberalism as an attack on all traditional values.

> __Liberalism is valued the most when people experience life in an illiberal world__. The doctrine itself arose in Europe after the 150 years of unremitting religious warfare that followed the Protestant Reformation. It was reborn in the wake of Europe’s destructive nationalistic wars of the early 20th century. A liberal order was institutionalised in the form of the European Union, and the broader global order of open trade and investment created by US power. [...]

> However, more than a generation has passed now since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and __the virtues of living in a liberal world have been taken for granted by many.__ [...]

> Into this void have stepped illiberal authoritarian regimes. Those of Russia, China, Syria, Venezuela, Iran and Nicaragua have little in common other than the fact that they dislike liberal democracy and want to maintain their own authoritarian power. They have created a network of mutual support that has allowed, for example, the despicable regime of Nicolás Maduro in Caracas to survive despite having driven more than a fifth of Venezuela’s population into exile.

> At the centre of this network is Putin’s Russia [...]

> The travails of liberalism will not end even if Putin loses. China will be waiting in the wings, as well as Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and the populists in western countries. But the world will have learnt what the value of a liberal world order is, and that it will not survive unless people struggle for it and show each other mutual support. The Ukrainians, more than any other people, have shown what true bravery is, and that the spirit of 1989 remains alive in their corner of the world. For the rest of us, it has been slumbering and is being reawakened.
