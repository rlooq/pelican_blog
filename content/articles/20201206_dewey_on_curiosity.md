Title: Dewey On Curiosity
Date: 2020-12-06
Description: John Dewey's assertion that curiosity is the mother of all learning.

The overriding theme of John Dewey's works was a profound belief in democracy. He asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists **a fully formed public opinion**, accomplished by communication among citizens, experts and politicians.

He is often quoted in the context of **education** and **personal improvement**. Some of his classic bite-sized insights are:

* *We do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience.*
* *Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.*
* *We only think when we are confronted with problems.*

The text below is an extract from his 1910 book *How We Think*. Under the heading "Natural Resources in the Training of Thought" he lists *curiosity*, *suggestion*, and *orderliness*. These are his views regarding the former:

## Curiosity

[...] The wisest of the Greeks used to say that wonder is the mother of all science. An inert mind waits, as it were, for experiences to be imperiously forced upon it. The pregnant saying of Wordsworth:
> "The eye—it cannot choose but see;  
> We cannot bid the ear be still;  
> Our bodies feel, where'er they be,  
> Against or with our will"—  

holds good in the degree in which one is naturally possessed by curiosity. The curious mind is constantly alert and exploring, seeking material for thought, [...]. Eagerness for experience, for new and varied contacts, is found where wonder is found. Such curiosity is the only sure guarantee of the acquisition of the primary facts upon which inference must base itself.

### *Physical Curiosity*

In its first manifestations, curiosity is a vital overflow, an expression of an abundant organic energy. A physiological uneasiness leads a child to be "into everything,"—to be reaching, poking, pounding, prying. [...] Objects are sucked, fingered, and thumped; drawn and pushed, handled and thrown; in short, experimented with, till they cease to yield new qualities. Such activities are hardly intellectual, and yet without them intellectual activity would be feeble and intermittent through lack of stuff for its operations.

### *Social Curiosity*

A higher stage of curiosity develops under the influence of social stimuli. When the child learns that he can appeal to others to eke out his store of experiences, so that, if objects fail to respond interestingly to his experiments, he may call upon persons to provide interesting material, a new epoch sets in. "What is that?" "Why?" become the unfailing signs of a child's presence. [...] His *why* is not a demand for scientific explanation; the motive behind it is simply eagerness for a larger acquaintance with the mysterious world in which he is placed. The search is not for a law or principle, but only for a bigger fact. Yet there is more than a desire to accumulate just information or heap up disconnected items, although sometimes the interrogating habit threatens to degenerate into a mere disease of language. In the feeling, however dim, that the facts which directly meet the senses are not the whole story, that there is more behind them and more to come from them, lies the germ of intellectual curiosity.

### *Intellectual Curiosity*

Curiosity rises above the organic and the social planes and becomes intellectual in the degree in which it is transformed into interest in problems provoked by the observation of things and the accumulation of material. When the question is not discharged by being asked of another, when the child continues to entertain it in his own mind and to be alert for whatever will help answer it, curiosity has become a positive intellectual force. [...] If germinating powers are not used and cultivated at the right moment, they tend to be transitory, to die out, or to wane in intensity. [...] 

Bacon's saying that we must become as little children in order to enter the kingdom of science is at once a reminder of the open-minded and flexible wonder of childhood and of the ease with which this endowment is lost. Some lose it in indifference or carelessness; [...]. Others retain curiosity only with reference to what concerns their personal advantage in their chosen career. With many, curiosity is arrested on the plane of interest in local gossip and in the fortunes of their neighbors; indeed, so usual is this result that very often the first association with the word curiosity is a prying inquisitiveness into other people's business. 

With respect then to curiosity, the teacher has usually more to learn than to teach. Rarely can he aspire to the office of kindling or even increasing it. His task is rather to keep alive the sacred spark of wonder and to fan the flame that already glows. His problem is to protect the spirit of inquiry, to keep it from becoming blasé from overexcitement, wooden from routine, fossilized through dogmatic instruction, or dissipated by random exercise upon trivial things.
