Title: Of Graves, Worms and Epitaphs
Date: 2015-07-30


This is an extract from *The Life and Death of King Richard the Second*, commonly called *Richard II*, a history play by William Shakespeare written in approximately 1595. 

It is based on the life of King Richard II of England (ruled 1377â€“1399) and is the first part of a tetralogy, referred to by some scholars as the Henriad, followed by three plays concerning Richard's successors: Henry IV, Part 1; Henry IV, Part 2; and Henry V.

__Context__: King Richard, who has been engaged in the Irish wars, returns to England to find that his Welsh army has been dispersed on a rumor of his death, and his exiled cousin Bolingbroke has come back to claim his inheritance, leading a successful rebellion against Richard. 
To top it off, Richard's companions (Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire), who had stayed in England in charge of the Castle of Bristol, have been executed by Bolingbroke. He is *clearly not in a cheerful mood*.



### Act 3, Scene 2. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.

[...]
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;  
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes  
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,  
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:  
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath  
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?  
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,  
And nothing can we call our own but death  
And that small model of the barren earth  
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.  
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground  
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;  
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,  
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;  
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;  
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown  
That rounds the mortal temples of a king  
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,  
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,  
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,  
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,  
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,  
As if this flesh which walls about our life,  
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus  
Comes at the last and with a little pin  
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!  
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood  
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,  
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,  
For you have but mistook me all this while:  
I live with bread like you, feel want,  
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,  
How can you say to me, I am a king?
