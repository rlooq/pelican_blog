Title: Out of Focus

Description: The difficulty of obsessions in an world with short attention span.

"Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly" says Kafka. 

"My advice to anyone in any field is to be faithful to your obsessions. Identify them and be faithful to them, let them guide you like a sleepwalker" insists old J.G. Ballard. 

Both Franz and J.G. talk about unrelentless commitment beyond any logic or utility. But obsessions aren't easy in the 21st century: our attention span has shortened dramatically, the 'fashion' invades your very soul, and where was I? Oh, yes, sure, old Franz didn't have it easy either: he had to put his own obsessions in the back burner while he worked all day, and then deal with them all night long. 

I picture him cautiously lighting the oil lamp as soon as he got to his room, just enough to see the sheets of paper. The world around him fading into black: no visible corners, no distractions, just the limelight on his own ghosts. Then he would carefully dip the quill in the ink bottle, or was it a dip pen? Whatever. The old business of surviving first, and thriving next.

Today that same business is conducted in a pool of constant interruptions and uncertainty. Our brains are being messed with 24/7 and there's always something else we could be doing but you could be wrong: another recommended YouTube video before you've even finished this one; another link, yet another tab on your browser, or why not, another app to download; the backspace key always offering you the choice to 'improve' the sentence you just typed. 

One million blinking arrows pointing in just as many directions in your head, as the wife presses "Are you listening to what I'm saying?" and you realize your mind is actually blank: all white noise.

Yes, attention is an extremely scarce commodity these days. Concentration a luxury of monks. The advocates of meditation and mindfulness make their point, but it may be too late: the wiring has been irreparably damaged, so we better learn to live with it. The young ones can't even think of a different state of things. We're a different species altogether from Franz and J.G.

So accept it, nothing will ever get your undivided attention again, it's just impossible to choose one star in the universe. 

You may persevere in a different way, though. Five minutes here and there, until it all adds up to a dissociated, incomplete sense of unity. Maybe before you die, if you're lucky. Hey, it's the journey that counts.

Always walking the fine line between perseverance and futility. That is the one thing that has never changed, has it, Franz?
