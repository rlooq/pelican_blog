Title: A Tale Of Three Internets
Date: 2020-12-09
Description: The fragmentation of the internet, although no one is totally free of snooping eyes.

In [this article](https://english.elpais.com/the_global_observer/2020-12-08/a-world-with-three-internets.html) from the [Global Observer column](https://english.elpais.com/news/the_global_observer/), on [El País in English](https://english.elpais.com), Moisés Naím describes how the internet, originally a tool for liberation, is turning into another weapon in a growing arsenal of repression used by countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc.

At the other end of the spectrum we have the American model, which appears to be free (as in free beer), but is paid for with our most personal data: Google, Facebook and WhatsApp, Twitter, etc. know you better than yourself. That knowledge "enables them to dominate the lucrative market of global advertising," which is in itself a powerful tool for control, albeit less forceful than outright censorhip. You’ve probably had the annoying experience of being followed by advertisement of a particular product for weeks, no matter which web site you visited. It may sound silly, but products and services carry all kinds of messages, and as the nazi propagandist said, "a lie told once remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth."

> Repetition generates very deep beliefs. When the brain encounters a new situation, there is an imbalance. After this comes assimilation, accommodation, and then adaptation. It’s like when we arrive in a new city and at first, we feel lost. But, little by little, after we see the same places over and over, we start to feel familiarized with the city. Eventually, our new surroundings become part of us. In fact, we make a sort of personal map of what we learn.

> Something very similar happens with lies. The mind adapts to listen to the lie, perceive it, and then incorporates it into its sphere of thought. It is familiar, well-known. It is what everyone else agrees with. In the case of lies from power sectors, it is also the answer to a fear or insecurity. Or it might be the understandable explanation for something we don’t know or can’t comprehend. [^1]

Moisés Naím goes on to stress the fragmentation of the global internet into these two blocks, but brings up a third one in Europe. So three blocks:
1. The Chinese internet is closed, censored and protectionist.
2. The American model is anarchic, innovative, aggressively commercial and with strong monopolistic tendencies by giants like Google or Facebook.
3. Europe offers an alternative internet, without the flaws of the American model and the abuses of the Chinese one. "The European internet is more regulated, tries to protect users, confronts monopolies and defends democratic values." (e.g. [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation), fines to Google Apple and Microsoft, etc.)

Call me a cynic, or a killjoy, but I'm afraid there's a lot of wishful thinking in Brussels, while we carry Chinese smartphones and smart watches everywhere we go, and share everlything on Facebook and Whatsapp. In the long term, the giants usually end up winning. But in the meantime, *maybe* we can resist a little longer. Go EU!
