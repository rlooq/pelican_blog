Title: Sesame Street News

Description: Annoying habits spreading among some news media, or Too Much Information.

In recent years, we have seen many a change in the way news is reported by major media outlets, from click-bait headlines to the way they choose and tell stories. I'm not talking about annoying euphemisms or dancing around whatever is deemed politically-incorrect, which I can understand to a certain extent. It's a balance act, and it has to be done. 

What I'm referring to now is adding paragraphs to explain almost every historical term that they mention, lest the fickle reader should get overwhelmed and leave for the comfort of Facebook. [This BBC story about Ukraine tensions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60422103) is a case in point (the __bold__ is mine):

> The West rejects the idea that Russia has a right to influence the foreign policy of countries close to its borders, as the Soviet Union did during the __Cold War__.  

> __The Cold War was the post-war period of the 20th Century when the rivalry between the West and the Soviet Union brought two global superpowers to the brink of nuclear war.__  

> Joe Biden warned on Thursday that Russia could be about to engage in a __false flag operation__ which would give it an excuse to invade Ukraine.  

>  __A false flag is a fabricated attack a country stages against its own interests in order to justify a retaliation. Russia denies having any such plans.__

In their Style Guide, BBC claims that:
> Audiences expect the BBC to demonstrate the highest standards of English because well-written stories are easier to understand.

But I haven't found any reference to this over-explaining.

While I appreciate the help, do they have to take it this far in the age of Google and Wikipedia? It's a distraction, and a bit condescending. I don't claim to know every historical reference out there, but it takes less than a second to look it up. There's no need to torture us all with these dictionary definitions in mid-article.
