## What

This is first of all a [__personal blog__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#Types "...the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than the blogger's immediate family and friends..."). I write about stuff that piques my interest in a sort of journal format. I started it as an exercise to help me think in English and give a more solid shape to my blurry ideas. I heard someone say that writing is a tool for thinking in a more structured way. 

It's also a [__commonplace book__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) where I collect notes, and documentation about subjects like literature, philosophy, practical technology tips, etc. The goal is to have them handy from my phone when needed. If you find them useful too, be my guest.

With that in mind, I've purposely kept the design simple, dark and readable, easy on the eyes: text is the priority, so don't expect many pictures. Look at it as a kind of *comfy, ebook-reader interface*, ideal for smartphones or tablets. 

Occasionally I also post __partial extracts or full-length texts from public-domain works__ (mostly classics from project Gutenberg and similar sources), accompanied by notes about vocabulary, cultural references or other trivia. They're meant to be read on the go when time needs killing: commutes, waiting rooms, etc. Feel free to geek out if you enjoy random bits of classic literature or forgotten rarities in a readable, accessible format. Hopefully they will lead to surprising discoveries and whet your appetite for the actual books.


## Who

I may sound dry at first, but overall, I’m a nice, friendly guy keeping busy and trying to stay sharp. Unfortunately (or not), I’m interested in too many things to claim any kind of *niche* expertise. My professional background is linguistics, dealing mostly with translation, localization and language learning. I live in Spain.


## Why

Everybody needs pet projects, especially as they approach middle age.

## Where

You may also find me posting doodles and pictures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/randomlooq/) from time to time.
